# Add any notes / discussion threads here :

### Preliminary research
- get started with the repo's [setup guide](https://github.com/nadiaenh/raspberry-pi/blob/main/setup%20guide%20and%20faq.md) 
or the [official RasPi guide](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/raspberry-pi-setting-up) 
- what are the best practices for walking robots ? what's been done before and works well ?   
- take into account things like center of gravity, total weight and weight of individual parts, the different needs of biped vs quadriped walking (vs wheels ?)
- look into the walking patterns of spiders (for quadriped) or humans (for biped) and the mechanisms of the legs (the way the articulations move in sync with each other)

### Assembling 
- which [kind of motor](https://www.seeedstudio.com/blog/2019/04/01/choosing-the-right-motor-for-your-project-dc-vs-stepper-vs-servo-motors/) ? consider power needs and noise
- which kind of power supply is best ? basic RasPi power adapter, portable (rechargeable?) batteries, portable generator ?
- look into the pieces : 3d printed ? cardboard cutouts ? random scraps that do the job ? plastic ? metal ? wood ? consider weights, heat resistance, wear and tear over time.
