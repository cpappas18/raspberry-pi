# Quick setup
I'll update this guide later on to be specific to the model we will be using.  

**:heavy_check_mark: You will need:**  
- Your Raspberry Pi board 
- A Raspberry Pi power supply 
- A microSD card and its adapter
- *(optional)* An extra monitor, keyboard, and mouse  
- *(optional)* A Raspberry Pi case

**:one: Setup your microSD:**  
If your microSD didn't come pre-loaded with Raspbian, you will need to install it manually. For that, 
download the [Raspberry Pi Imager](https://www.raspberrypi.org/software/) that matches your computer's operating system. Launch 
the installer and follow the instructions. Plug your microSD in its adapter into your computer. Choose **Raspberry Pi OS**, choose the microSD you 
want to overwrite, then click on **Write**.
The software will tell you when it's okay to eject your microSD.  
*Note: anything on the microSD will be overwritten !*  

**:two: Connect your Raspberry Pi:**  
Do **NOT** plug it into the power supply just yet ! It's important to hook everything up in the correct order.  
Insert the microSD in the Raspberry Pi microSD slot.  

**:three: If you have an extra monitor, keyboard and mouse:**  
Now is the time to plug them in. If you don't, go to step :four:.  
You can then plug in the power supply and turn on the Raspberry Pi.  
Follow the setup instructions on the screen, and that's it ! üëè

**:four: If you don't have a monitor, keyboard and mouse:**  
You can still use the Raspberry Pi on your laptop directly, but a couple more steps are needed.  
I'll update this guide soon with the instructions.  

# Frequently Asked Questions

:question:**What‚Äôs a Raspberry Pi?**  
It is a tiny and affordable computer that runs on a version of Linux called Raspbian. 

:question:**How is it used?**  
You can plug a keyboard and monitor to it and it works exactly the same as a desktop computer. 
Alternatively, you can attach a bunch of extra stuff to it (camera, LED lights, wires, motors, wheels, weather sensors, etc.) and make cool projects ! 

:question:**What language does it use?**  
Raspbian comes pre-loaded with Python, the official language of Raspberry Pi.  
It can use a bunch of other languages though, such as HTML5 and Java.  

:question:**Do I need to have one to work on this project?**  
No. If you want to fiddle with it too then by all means get one (Chloe and I will have one), but it‚Äôs not mandatory. 
 
:question:**Which model should I get?**  
Once we decide the scope of this project, I will be updating this document with links to everything you might need.    
Generally speaking, the criterias to consider when choosing a Rasberry Pi are speed (processing power), memory (RAM/ROM/HD), 
size and weight, cost, amount of I/O support available, networking capabilities (WiFi, Bluetooth, etc.)  

:question:**Where can I buy one?**  
[The official website](https://www.raspberrypi.org/), [Canakit](https://www.canakit.com/), [BuyAPi](https://www.buyapi.ca/), or Amazon !  

:question:**Where can I buy extra stuff?**  
Amazon sells starter kits with a bunch of LEDs, wires, motors, wheels etc.  
You can also check out websites like [Canada Robotix](https://www.canadarobotix.com/) !
